              <p>Born of stardust on the fourth of March, 1985 to the planet of Earth. The name handed down to him by his forefathers was Zacharias. The name given to him by his parents was Nathan. The name itself is derived of the Hebrew verb, Natan, meaning <i>"gave"</i> or <i>"He has given"</i>, translated into English as <i>"Given of God"</i>. But the gift, was in fact, his own.</p><p><b><i>The Gift of Life.</i></b></p>
