              <p>Born of stardust on the fourth of March, 1985 to the planet of Earth. The name handed down to him by his forefathers was Zacharias. The name given to him by his parents was Nathan. The name itself is derived of the Hebrew verb, Natan, meaning <i>"gave"</i> or <i>"He has given"</i>, translated into English as <i>"Given of God"</i>. But the gift, was in fact, his own.</p><p><b><i>The Gift of Life.</i></b></p>
              <p>It could be said that the achievement of conception is the equivalent of winning the universal lottery, but there's more to winning a race then luck. It takes sheer will and determination to be that one out of a million to reach the finish line. The finish line in this case, the egg, is in reality just the starting line for the greatest race we'll ever run. A race that will require Endurance. Dedication. Perseverance.</p>
              <p><b><i>The Race of Life.</i></b></p>
              <p>A race that we chose to enter. The choice to trade Comfort for Distress. Safety for Vulnerability. Assuredness for Discomposure. The goal? <i>Experience.</i> The gift of life is the gift of experience. The ups and downs, the ebb and flow. The bonechilling cold of the rain from a thunderstorm that allows you to truly appreciate the warmth of the sun on your skin. <i>That</i> is the Gift of Life. The Gift of Experience. <b><i>The Gift of Love.</i></b></p>
